    <h3>DIFFICULTIES OF HAVING NO WORKING MATERIAL</h3>


    <img src="pic2.jpg" height="400" width="650">
    <p>These are the difficulties that students who really need assistance face during the times they are with us. There are no proper chalkboards, only cardboards that aren’t adequate enough for even a single equation to fit. Though circumstances like this makes some students lose interest in coming to get help, there are some who still bear with us and does not let this be a hindrance to their education because they know what they want for their futures. We are optimistic that someday we will have enough equipment that we need in order to make this project successful. In the previous year, we produced one of the best students in the province using this cardboard as our chalkboard. So I believe that if we can get proper chalkboards and other material that we need we can produce more people who pass with excellent results through hard work.</p>
